## Introduction

The ridership of the QCity Bus Program (QCBP) of Quezon City Government has continuously increased since its enactment, proving its valuable service to its citizens. The efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of its transportation development are enhanced by proper contract management. Yet, incompatible contract features and ineffective managerial practices of the QCBP were identified by the LGU, leading to setbacks in attaining the program’s overall goals and objectives of a reliable, safe, comfortable, and convenient public transportation service. Correspondingly, existing studies on public transportation service contracting focus only on customer satisfaction and cost efficiency, but not the underlying contract management aspect of QCBP, leading to a theoretical and empirical research gap. 

Resolving these research gaps would better inform inquiries relating to the sustainability of the project and provide insights for improving the dynamics between the city government and the bus operator. As Quezon City pioneers such a model, studying the overlying regulatory governance framework could improve its applicability in other local government units.

## Research Question & Objectives
How efficient, effective, and sustainable is the service-contracting model for the implementation of the QCity Bus Program? 
In line with this main research question, the following must also be answered:
1. To what degree does the QCity Bus Program, through its current contract management scheme, meet its objectives of being a reliable, safe, comfortable, and convenient public transportation service?
2. How do the existing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms under the service-contracting model for the QCity Bus enhance the program's overall implementation? 
3. What are the key challenges and opportunities associated with granting local governments like Quezon City the authority to operate and manage their own transport services through a service contracting model?

Overall, this study aims to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of the service-contracting model in the implementation of the QCity Bus Program in Quezon City. Specifically, this study aims to:
- To evaluate the performance of the QCity Bus Program in achieving its goals of providing a reliable, safe, comfortable, and convenient public transportation system under the service-contracting framework;
- To analyze the role of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms within the service-contracting model and their impact on the program’s operational success and continuous improvement;
- To identify the challenges and opportunities for local governments like Quezon City in managing and operating public transport services through a service-contracting approach, with a focus on lessons for scalability and sustainability.
